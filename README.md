## A package for manipulating `security.txt` documents in PHP 7+, based on configuration settings.

The purpose of this project is to create a set-it-and-forget-it package that can
manipulate documents following the current [`security.txt`](https://securitytxt.org/)
spec. It is therefore highly opinionated but built for configuration.

[`security.txt`](https://github.com/securitytxt) is a [draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00)
"standard" which allows websites to define security policies. This "standard"
sets clear guidelines for security researchers on how to report security issues,
and allows bug bounty programs to define a scope. Security.txt is the equivalent
of `robots.txt`, but for security issues.

There is [documentation for `php-security-txt` online](https://austinheap.github.io/php-security-txt/),
the source of which is in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/austinheap/php-security-txt/tree/master/docs)
directory. The most logical place to start are the [docs for the `SecurityTxt` class](https://austinheap.github.io/php-security-txt/classes/AustinHeap.Security.Txt.SecurityTxt.html).

## Installation

### Step 1: Composer

Via Composer command line:

```bash
$ composer require austinheap/php-security-txt
```

Or add the package to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "austinheap/php-security-txt": "0.3.*"
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Manipulate a `security.txt` document

To programatically create a `security.txt` document, you could do:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$writer = new \AustinHeap\Security\Txt\Writer;

print $writer->setContact('me@austinheap.com')
             ->setEncryption('http://some.url/pgp.key')
             ->setDisclosure('full')
             ->setAcknowledgement('http://some.url/acks')
             ->getText();
```

Which should output:

```
# Our security address
Contact: me@austinheap.com

# Our PGP key
Encryption: http://some.url/pgp.key

# Our disclosure policy
Disclosure: Full

# Our public acknowledgement
Acknowledgement: http://some.url/acks
